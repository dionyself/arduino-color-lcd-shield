arduino-color-lcd-shield
========================

A driver library for the color LCD arduino shield from ElecFreaks, a Nokia
6100 display with a Philips PCF8833 controller. It meant to be a drop-in
replacement for the library you can download from ElecFreaks
(http://www.elecfreaks.com/store/color-lcd-shield-p-462.html).

The ElecFreaks shield is based on SparkFun Electronics' Color LCD Shield
(http://www.sparkfun.com/products/9363).  That shield sometimes uses another
driver circuit, an Epson S1D15G00.
